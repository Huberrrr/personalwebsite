          Hi! My name is Jon Huber, and I am currently a junior attending Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. I was born and raised in Southern California but went to college out in the Midwest for a change in pace. I am studying computer science, with a specialization in software engineering and a certificate of entrepreneurship. I expect to complete my degree in May of 2021.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-2">
          During the summer after my freshman year, I interned with <b><a class="secondary" href="https://pulsevoter.com/">Pulse Voter</a></b> â€“ a tech startup based in Stanford that helps citizens by allowing them to directly vote on bills/issues or to directly message their representatives, providing a platform for active civic engagement. Working with Pulse allowed me to learn the basics of full stack development and how to collaborate on a live project.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-2">
          This past summer I worked at IBM in San Jose as a full stack developer intern on the Watson Knowledge Catalog (WKC) UI team. WKC is a smart cataloging system integrated with an enterprise data governance platform. There I contributed new production-level components to the React frontend, built new APIs for the backend-for-frontend, fixed 46 broken Jest unit test cases, and corrected frontend design implementation flaws.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-2">
          During my rare free time, I enjoy discovering new food around town, skiing in the winter, or just staying in and playing board games with my friends.

                At Pulse Voter, I redeveloped the site for elected officials from the ground up and added more features including: a restful API, a customized homepage, options for representatives to export information about a bill and its votes to a CSV file, a Google Map showing all the voters in their district and their information/voting history, and in-depth statistics on specific bills. Representatives actively use this site to view bills currently in Congress and analyze voter opinions in their district.

                As a side project during my second semester of college, I decided that I wanted to explore the world of Discord (an online chat service centered around gaming) and its chat bots. I found a game that didn't have any existing statistics bots, Halo Wars 2, and I created one for the community. The bot provides players their statistics in every gamemode, and even compiles their data to give them an overall look at their career for the game. It maintained an average of 1000 active users in 10 dedicated communities.

                For DemonHacks 2018, our team decided to create a restaurant point-of-sale system because one of our members' dad needed one that wasn't terrible for his restaurant. We decided to use the MERN stack hosted on Google Cloud because it was the perfect balanace of previous knowledge and new stuff for a hackathon. I was tasked with creating the entire React frontend including: a home page with items and checkout function, a management page for adding/editing/deleting items in the MongoDB database, and a transaction log. I also managed the project structure so that 4 members of the team could all efficiently work on a different part at the same time.

                For our software engineering class, our team designed and created a mobile workout logging application using the Agile methodology. The inspiration came from several of our members being frustrated with how lack-luster the current applications available were. Our design choices were pretty simple: we picked React Native in order to develop for all platforms easily and MongoDB because our members had previous experience. My main contribution was on the frontend side because I was the one with the most experience, so I would be useful in helping other members learn. I ended up designing and creating the calendar page, profile page, and nutrition pages.

                For an open ended project in our systems programming class, a couple of my friends and I created an online chat server using the MERN stack that translates every message sent through 4 languages and then back to English. While setting up this project, I learned a lot about the importance of project structure, bundlers, and dev ops. For this project, I worked as a full stack developer. I designed and implemented the frontend from scratch, and also helped out on the backend with the sockets.

                For the IBM Intern Hacakthon our group wanted to use artificial intelligence to build something fun. The idea we came up with was a mobile app that would help you play the board game Catan. Because of the time restriction, we decided to start out with just having the app suggest the optimal opening move. Throughout those two hectic days I acted as team leader, created the frontend in React Native, and integrated backend algorithms together with the frontend. By the end of it, our minimum viable product was all written and working, we just did not have enough time to train our image recognition model to be as accurate as we wanted.
